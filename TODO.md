# Objectives :

1. Clone a repository D to D' (on demand, then automatically)
2. Synchronize the content of both directories
3. Add extra stuff to be more "interesting" in comparison to other projects.



# Constraints :

- Must be usable and robust : No bug - all functionalities are properly implemented
- Need some documents to be written :
	=> A user manual
	=> Explanation of the code structure
	=> Extra functionality overview
- Directories can be on different computers (use of network)
- The tool must have a GUI
