# Objectives :

1. Clone a repository D to D' (on demand, then automatically)
2. Synchronize the content of both directories
3. Add extra stuff to be more "interesting" in comparison to other projects.



# Constraints :

- Must be usable and robust : No bug - all functionalities are properly implemented
- Need some documents to be written :
	- A user manual
	- Explanation of the code structure
	- Extra functionality overview
- Directories can be on different computers (use of network)
- The tool must have a GUI


# UML :

- Use Case : represent all functionalities
- Sequence Diagrams : scenarii or execution of a particular operation
- Statecharts : describing the global behavior of the system or its components
- Class' Diagram (detailed) : software architecture to be implemented
- Object/Communication Diagrams : illustrating a particular organization or operation
- Deployment Diagram : to illustrate the networking part of the application


# Ideas : 
- Create a backup system, where you can clone a folder to an archive file (manually and periodically)
